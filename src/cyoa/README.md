## Choose Your Own Adventure
I made this game in my first semester, as soon as I learned how to read files from disk.

It's a choose your own adventure game, where the story and prompts were stored in two
separate files, with line numbers pointing to where in the other file the next bit of
text is. In this way, anyone could make their own cyoa, but in retrospect the jumping
between files with file numbers made it pretty difficult to follow.
