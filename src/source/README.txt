This folder contains all the source code from the original programs I wrote
while learning programming in college. All mistakes, poor choices, typos, etc.
are left in their original form. The actual games you can play on this site
have been ported to javascript, and a handful of minor edits have been made.
However, the gameplay should be basically identical to the original form.

NOTE: these files can include spoilers for the story-based games. I suggest
you play through the games before you look at the code for them.
