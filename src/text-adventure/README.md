## Text adventure game
This is an implementation of a text adventure engine which we wrote for OOP class
in college.

The engine supported custom "games" by specifying game worlds using an xml format,
which would be loaded at startup by specifying which file to use on the command line.

This port uses a json world definition instead. Maybe later, I'll support making and
specifying your own games...
